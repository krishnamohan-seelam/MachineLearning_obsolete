Cairo's principle of truthfulness : I made sure that   visualization used the correct data. The dataset consisted of   details various states,  causes  etc. Since i am interested on the  question of which age category  males/females  prone to suicide at national level .  I used data filtering  available  in pandas to select the required data which would prevent misinterpretation of data.

Cairo's principle of beauty: As Alberto Cairo said in the book "The truthful art" -data visualization isnâ€™t the same as data decoration.I tried to present the information in  much simpler, clearer, and tried to visualize in an elegant way.

Cairo's principle of functionality:I wanted to track which  age category poses more risk to suicides in males and  females  over time line of 2001 -2013 . I represented  this information  via  line graph.    

Cairo's principle of insightfulness:I tried visualize  the question Which age category poses more risk to suicides in males and  females ?  using  histogram and  pie chart but  these were complicating the visualization and not clean or clear in explaining the insight to the above  question.

clear the path to making valuable discoveries that would be inaccessible if the information were presented in a different way
